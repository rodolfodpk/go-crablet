## **üéØ DCB Pattern Analysis**

### **Consistency Boundary Implementation**

The benchmarks demonstrate proper DCB pattern implementation:

```go
// ‚úÖ DCB Pattern: Specific course category instead of all courses
query := dcb.NewQuery(dcb.NewTags("category", "Computer Science"), "CourseDefined")

// ‚úÖ DCB Pattern: Specific student major instead of all students  
query := dcb.NewQuery(dcb.NewTags("major", "Computer Science"), "StudentRegistered")

// ‚úÖ DCB Pattern: Specific enrollment grade instead of all enrollments
query := dcb.NewQuery(dcb.NewTags("grade", "A"), "StudentEnrolledInCourse")

// ‚úÖ DCB Pattern: Cross-entity consistency check
query := dcb.Query{
    Items: []dcb.QueryItem{
        {EventTypes: []string{"CourseDefined"}, Tags: dcb.NewTags("course_id", "course-1")},
        {EventTypes: []string{"StudentRegistered"}, Tags: dcb.NewTags("student_id", "student-1")},
    },
}
```

### **Business Decision Boundaries**

Projectors represent real business scenarios:

```go
// ‚úÖ Business Decision: Count CS courses
projector := dcb.BatchProjector{
    ID: "csCourseCount",
    StateProjector: dcb.StateProjector{
        Query: dcb.NewQuery(dcb.NewTags("category", "Computer Science"), "CourseDefined"),
        InitialState: 0,
        TransitionFn: func(state any, event dcb.Event) any { return state.(int) + 1 },
    },
}
```
