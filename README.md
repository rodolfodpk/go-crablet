# go-crablet

A Go library for event sourcing, exploring concepts inspired by Sara Pellegrini's Dynamic Consistency Boundary (DCB) pattern. 

## ðŸš€ Key Features

**Core API - EventStore:**
- **DCB-inspired decision models**: Project multiple states and check business invariants in a single query
- **DCB concurrency control**: Append events only if no conflicting events exist within the same query scope (uses the DCB approach, not classic optimistic locking; transaction IDs ensure correct event ordering, inspired by Oskarâ€™s article)
- **Memory-efficient streaming**: Process events row-by-row for large event streams
- **PostgreSQL-backed**: Uses PostgreSQL for robust, concurrent event storage
- **Robust error handling**: Two-tier error handling with guaranteed transaction rollback

**Optional API - CommandExecutor:**
- **Atomic command execution**: Execute commands with handler-based event generation using the CommandExecutor pattern
- **Command tracking**: Automatic storage of commands in the `commands` table with transaction ID linking

## ðŸ“Š Performance

- **[Benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md)**: Comprehensive performance analysis including Go library and HTTP API
- **[Performance Comparison](docs/performance-comparison.md)**: Go library vs web-app performance analysis and recommendations
- **[Performance Analysis](docs/performance-improvements.md)**: Technical optimizations and I/O operation analysis

*For benchmark execution commands, see [Development Guide](docs/getting-started.md).*
