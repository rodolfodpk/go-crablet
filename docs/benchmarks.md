## Performance Characteristics

### Strengths
1. **Good Reliability**: 100% success rates across all test scenarios
2. **Fast Response Times**: Sub-second response times for most operations
3. **Good Concurrency**: Handles 20-100 concurrent users effectively
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Proper handling of conditional append conflicts
5. **Isolation Level Flexibility**: All isolation levels perform well

### Performance Considerations
1. **High Concurrency**: Response times increase under extreme load (100 VUs)
2. **Batch Operations**: Performance varies with batch sizes
3. **Connection Pool**: May need tuning for higher concurrency scenarios

### System Capabilities
- ✅ **Stable Performance**: Consistent results across all tests
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with 0% failure rates
- ✅ **Scalability**: Good performance up to moderate concurrency levels
- ✅ **Conflict Resolution**: Proper handling of concurrent modifications

## Configuration Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Connection Pool**: Consider increasing pool size for high-concurrency applications
2. **Batch Sizes**: Optimize batch sizes based on your specific use case
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor response times and adjust concurrency limits accordingly
4. **Isolation Level**: Use Read Committed for most cases, Serializable when needed

### Performance Tuning
1. **Long-Running Tests**: Run tests for longer durations to check for memory leaks
2. **Database Scaling**: Test with larger datasets and more complex queries
3. **Network Latency**: Test with simulated network latency
4. **Failover Scenarios**: Test database failover and recovery scenarios
