# Performance Benchmarks Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to performance testing and benchmarking in the go-crablet project with **production-ready performance**.

## Overview

go-crablet includes comprehensive performance testing across multiple components to ensure optimal performance for event sourcing applications. Our benchmarking strategy covers:

- **Core Library Performance**: Go-level benchmarks for the DCB pattern implementation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: For PostgreSQL database
- **Go**: For running servers and benchmarks
- **k6**: For HTTP/gRPC load testing (`brew install k6` on macOS)
- **k6-grpc**: For gRPC testing (`k6 install xk6-grpc`)

### Running All Benchmarks

1. **Start PostgreSQL**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   ```

2. **Run Web-App Benchmarks**:
   ```bash
   cd internal/web-app
   make benchmark
   ```

3. **Run gRPC Benchmarks**:
   ```bash
   cd internal/grpc-app
   make benchmark
   ```

4. **Run Go Benchmarks**:
   ```bash
   cd internal/benchmarks
   go run main.go
   ```

## Performance Expectations

### Web-App (HTTP/REST)
- **Quick Test**: ~8,164 requests, 816 req/s, 1.17ms avg, 1.79ms p95
- **Full Benchmark**: ~66,137 requests, 137 req/s, 28ms avg, 460ms p99
- **Success Rate**: 100% HTTP success, 98.24% performance threshold compliance
- **Zero Errors**: 0 HTTP failures, 0% custom error rate

### gRPC App
- **Quick Test**: Optimized for rapid validation with 1 VU
- **Full Benchmark**: Optimized for high-concurrency testing with 50 VUs
- **Success Rate**: 100% gRPC success, high performance threshold compliance
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput, low-latency communication

### Go Benchmarks
- **Append Performance**: Optimized for batch operations
- **Read Performance**: Efficient streaming with pgx
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal allocations for large datasets
- **Concurrency**: Thread-safe operations with connection pooling

## Performance Optimizations Applied

The system has been optimized for production performance with:

### **Database Configuration**
- **Connection Pool**: 200 max connections, 50 min connections
- **PostgreSQL Memory**: 2GB allocation for better performance
- **Health Check**: 30-second intervals for connection monitoring

### **Load Testing Configuration**
- **Max VUs**: 50 (reduced from 100 for stability)
- **Request Spacing**: 0.2s intervals for database recovery
- **Gentle Ramp-up**: 5 ‚Üí 15 ‚Üí 50 VUs over 8 minutes
- **Batch Size**: 5 requests per batch for stability

### **Database Indexes**
- **Position Index**: `idx_events_position` for sequential reads
- **Tags Index**: `idx_events_tags` using GIN for array queries
- **Type Index**: `idx_events_type` for type-based queries
- **Composite Indexes**: `idx_events_type_position` for optimized queries

## Benchmark Results Interpretation

### k6 Metrics to Watch
- **Success Rate**: Should be 100% for HTTP/gRPC requests
- **Response Times**: p95 should be under thresholds (200ms for most operations)
- **Throughput**: Requests per second under expected load
- **Error Rate**: Should be 0% for successful tests

### Go Benchmark Metrics
- **ns/op**: Nanoseconds per operation (lower is better)
- **B/op**: Bytes allocated per operation (lower is better)
- **allocs/op**: Memory allocations per operation (lower is better)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Port conflicts**: Use `lsof -i :8080` or `lsof -i :9090` to find and kill processes
- **Database connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running with `docker ps`
- **k6 not found**: Install from https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/
- **gRPC extension missing**: Install with `k6 install xk6-grpc`

### Performance Issues
- **High response times**: Check database performance and connection pooling
- **Low throughput**: Verify system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
- **Connection errors**: Check PostgreSQL max connections and connection limits

## Contributing to Benchmarks

### Adding New Tests
1. **k6 Scripts**: Add new test functions to existing scripts
2. **Go Benchmarks**: Add new benchmark functions to test files
3. **Documentation**: Update this overview and specific benchmark docs
4. **Thresholds**: Adjust performance thresholds based on new test patterns

### Best Practices
- **Consistent Environment**: Run benchmarks on similar hardware
- **Multiple Runs**: Run benchmarks multiple times to account for variance
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare against previous results
- **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor system resources during benchmarks

## Continuous Integration

Benchmarks are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to:
- **Regression Detection**: Catch performance regressions early
- **Trend Analysis**: Track performance over time
- **Release Validation**: Ensure releases meet performance criteria
- **Documentation**: Auto-generate performance reports

## Support

For benchmark-related issues:
- Check the troubleshooting section in each benchmark document
- Review server logs and k6 output
- Verify system resources and configuration
- Consult the specific benchmark documentation for detailed guidance

# Benchmarks

## gRPC Benchmarks

The latest gRPC benchmark results are available in [internal/grpc-app/BENCHMARK.md](../internal/grpc-app/BENCHMARK.md). Each test is run with a clean database using the HTTP `/cleanup` endpoint before the benchmark. Only the k6 screen output is shown for each scenario (quick, full, full-scan, concurrency).

Older reports have been removed to keep the documentation concise and up to date.
