# Local PostgreSQL Performance

## Realistic Benchmark Approach

**This documentation uses realistic benchmarks that represent actual business scenarios:**

- **Business Events**: `CourseOffered`, `StudentRegistered`, `EnrollmentCompleted` events
- **Realistic Data**: Proper JSON structures with business-relevant fields
- **Business Logic**: Course enrollment system with realistic projectors and conditions
- **Performance Focus**: Measures how the EventStore performs with actual business workloads

**Why Realistic Benchmarks?**
- **Business Relevance**: Performance data reflects real-world usage patterns
- **Meaningful Metrics**: Users can relate to course/student enrollment scenarios
- **Accurate Performance**: Shows how the EventStore handles realistic event structures
- **Production Readiness**: Validates performance for actual business applications

## Performance Results

### Throughput Calculation

**Throughput (ops/sec)** represents the number of API operations completed per second, calculated as:
- **Formula**: `total_operations / elapsed_time_seconds`
- **Where**: `total_operations = benchmark_iterations Ã— concurrency_level`
- **Example**: If a benchmark runs 1000 iterations with 10 concurrent users, total operations = 10,000
- **Measurement**: Uses Go's `testing.B.Elapsed()` for precise timing and `b.ReportMetric()` for reporting
- **Note**: This measures API calls per second, not individual events or database transactions

### Benchmark Warm-up Procedure

**All benchmarks include comprehensive warm-up to ensure accurate steady-state performance measurements:**

- **Application-level warm-up**: Each benchmark runs its core logic multiple times before timing begins
- **Database query plan warm-up**: PostgreSQL query plans are cached and optimized before measurements
- **JIT compiler warm-up**: Go's runtime optimizations are applied during warm-up iterations
- **Memory allocator warm-up**: Memory pools and allocation patterns are stabilized
- **CPU cache warm-up**: Instruction and data caches are populated with relevant data

**Warm-up Implementation**:
- **Pre-timing iterations**: Core benchmark logic runs without timing (`b.ResetTimer()` called after warm-up)
- **Database queries**: Append and Query operations are executed to warm up PostgreSQL query plans
- **Consistent environment**: All benchmarks use the same warm-up procedure for fair comparison
- **Steady-state measurement**: Only warmed-up performance is measured and reported

**Benefits**:
- **Accurate performance**: Eliminates cold-start effects and initialization overhead
- **Consistent results**: Reduces variance between benchmark runs
- **Real-world performance**: Reflects actual production performance characteristics
- **Fair comparison**: All operations start from the same warmed-up state
