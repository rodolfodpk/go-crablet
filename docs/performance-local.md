# Local PostgreSQL Performance

## Performance Results

### Throughput Calculation

**Throughput (ops/sec)** represents the number of API operations completed per second, calculated as:
- **Formula**: `total_operations / elapsed_time_seconds`
- **Where**: `total_operations = benchmark_iterations Ã— concurrency_level`
- **Example**: If a benchmark runs 1000 iterations with 10 concurrent users, total operations = 10,000
- **Measurement**: Uses Go's `testing.B.Elapsed()` for precise timing and `b.ReportMetric()` for reporting
- **Note**: This measures API calls per second, not individual events or database transactions

### Benchmark Warm-up Procedure

**All benchmarks include comprehensive warm-up to ensure accurate steady-state performance measurements:**

- **Application-level warm-up**: Each benchmark runs its core logic multiple times before timing begins
- **Database query plan warm-up**: PostgreSQL query plans are cached and optimized before measurements
- **JIT compiler warm-up**: Go's runtime optimizations are applied during warm-up iterations
- **Memory allocator warm-up**: Memory pools and allocation patterns are stabilized
- **CPU cache warm-up**: Instruction and data caches are populated with relevant data

**Warm-up Implementation**:
- **Pre-timing iterations**: Core benchmark logic runs without timing (`b.ResetTimer()` called after warm-up)
- **Database queries**: Append and Query operations are executed to warm up PostgreSQL query plans
- **Consistent environment**: All benchmarks use the same warm-up procedure for fair comparison
- **Steady-state measurement**: Only warmed-up performance is measured and reported

**Benefits**:
- **Accurate performance**: Eliminates cold-start effects and initialization overhead
- **Consistent results**: Reduces variance between benchmark runs
- **Real-world performance**: Reflects actual production performance characteristics
- **Fair comparison**: All operations start from the same warmed-up state

## Append Performance

**Append Operations Details**:
- **Operation**: Simple event append operations
- **Scenario**: Basic event writing without conditions or business logic
- **Events**: Single event (1) or batch (10 events)
- **Model**: Generic test events with simple JSON data

**Column Explanations**:
- **Dataset**: Test data size (Tiny: 5 courses/10 students, Small: 1K courses/10K students, Medium: 1K courses/10K students)
- **Concurrency**: Number of concurrent users/goroutines running operations simultaneously
- **Events**: Number of events appended per operation (1 = single event, 10 = batch of 10 events)
- **Throughput (ops/sec)**: Operations completed per second (higher is better)
- **Latency (ms/op)**: Time per operation in milliseconds (lower is better)
- **Memory (KB/op)**: Memory allocated per operation in kilobytes (lower is better)
- **Allocations**: Number of memory allocations per operation (lower is better)
