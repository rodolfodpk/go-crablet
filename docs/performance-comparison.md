# Performance Analysis

This document provides performance analysis for go-crablet's different operation modes and concurrency control mechanisms.

## ⚠️ Important: Do Not Compare Go vs Web Performance

**These performance measurements are for different purposes and should NOT be compared directly:**

### Go Library Performance
- **Purpose**: Measure core DCB algorithm performance
- **Scope**: Single-threaded, direct database access
- **Configuration**: Conservative database pool (10 connections)
- **Use Case**: Algorithm optimization and core performance
- **Expected Performance**: Very fast (1-10ms operations)

### Web App Performance  
- **Purpose**: Measure production HTTP API performance
- **Scope**: Concurrent HTTP service under load (100 VUs)
- **Configuration**: Production database pool (20 connections)
- **Use Case**: Production readiness and HTTP service performance
- **Expected Performance**: Slower due to HTTP overhead (100-1000ms operations)

### Why the Performance Difference is Expected
- **700x slower web performance is NORMAL** for a production HTTP service
- **Go benchmarks** measure algorithm efficiency
- **Web benchmarks** measure real-world API performance
- **Both are valuable** for their respective purposes
- **Direct comparison is misleading** and should be avoided

## Go Library Performance

### Core Algorithm Performance (2025-08-24)

**Purpose**: Measure DCB algorithm efficiency in isolation

#### Concurrency Control Performance

| Method | Throughput | Latency | Memory | Allocations |
|--------|------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Simple Append** | 926 ops/sec | 1.08ms | 1.5KB | 50 |
| **DCB Concurrency Control** | 4 ops/sec | 239-263ms | 19-20KB | 279-281 |

#### Detailed Metrics

#### Simple Append (No Consistency Checks)
- **Throughput**: ~926 operations/second (tiny dataset)
- **Latency**: ~1.08ms average
- **Memory Usage**: ~1.5KB per operation
- **Allocations**: ~50 allocations per operation
- **Use Case**: Event logging, audit trails, non-critical operations

#### DCB Concurrency Control
- **Throughput**: ~4 operations/second (tiny dataset)
- **Latency**: ~239-263ms average
- **Memory Usage**: ~19-20KB per operation
- **Allocations**: ~279-281 allocations per operation
- **Use Case**: Business operations with rules, consistency requirements

### Read and Projection Performance

| Operation | Throughput | Latency | Memory | Allocations |
|-----------|------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Simple Read** | 2,680 ops/sec | 373-404μs | 1.0KB | 22 |
| **Complex Queries** | 2,576 ops/sec | 387-424μs | 1.0KB | 22 |
| **Channel Streaming** | 2,470 ops/sec | 404-450μs | 108KB | 25 |
| **Single Projection** | 2,800 ops/sec | 357-356μs | 1.5KB | 31 |
| **Streaming Projections** | 2,560 ops/sec | 390-425μs | 10KB | 36-51 |

## Web App Performance

### HTTP API Performance (2025-08-24)

**Purpose**: Measure production HTTP service performance under load

#### HTTP API Performance

| Endpoint | Throughput | Latency | Success Rate | Load Test |
|----------|------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **POST /append** | 63.8 req/s | 786ms avg | 100% | 100 VUs, 4m20s |
| **POST /appendIf** | 31.8 req/s | 1.64s avg | 100% | 100 VUs, 4m20s |

#### Performance Analysis

#### HTTP Overhead Impact
The web app performance is significantly lower than the Go library due to:

1. **HTTP Serialization**: JSON marshaling/unmarshaling overhead
2. **Network Latency**: HTTP request/response cycles (even localhost)
3. **Connection Pooling**: Database connection management under concurrent load
4. **Middleware Processing**: Logging, validation, error handling
5. **Concurrent Request Handling**: Managing 100 simultaneous VUs

#### Performance Reality
- **Go Library**: ~926 ops/s (direct database access, single-threaded)
- **Web App**: ~64 req/s (HTTP API with concurrent load)
- **Overhead**: ~700x slower due to HTTP layer + concurrent load + production configuration

## Concurrency Control Analysis

### DCB Concurrency Control

#### Performance Characteristics
- **Go Library**: ~4 ops/s (algorithm performance)
- **Web App**: ~32 req/s (HTTP service performance)
- **Success Rate**: 100% under normal conditions
- **Memory Usage**: Higher due to condition checking and business logic

#### Use Cases
1. **Business Rule Validation**: Prevent duplicate enrollments
2. **State Consistency**: Ensure prerequisites exist
3. **Conflict Detection**: Fail-fast on concurrent modifications
4. **Domain Logic**: Enforce business constraints

#### What DCB Provides
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies when business rules are violated during event appends
- **Domain Constraints**: Allows you to define conditions that must be met before events can be stored
- **Consistent Performance**: Predictable behavior under load
- **Business Logic Enforcement**: Prevents invalid state transitions

#### Trade-offs
- **Performance**: Significantly slower than simple append due to condition checking
- **Complexity**: Requires condition definition and business logic
- **Memory**: Higher memory usage due to query execution and condition evaluation
- **Reliability**: Ensures business rule compliance

### Simple Append

- **Go Library**: ~926 ops/s (algorithm performance)
- **Web App**: ~64 req/s (HTTP service performance)
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Memory Usage**: ~1.5KB per operation

#### Use Cases
1. **Event Logging**: Audit trails, activity logs
2. **Non-critical Operations**: Background processing
3. **High-throughput Scenarios**: Bulk data ingestion
4. **Simple Workflows**: No business rule requirements

#### Characteristics
- **Higher Performance**: Faster than DCB operations due to no condition checking
- **Simplicity**: No condition setup required
- **Low Memory**: Minimal overhead
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance

## Performance Optimization

### Go Library Optimization
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Focus on core DCB implementation
- **Memory Management**: Optimize allocation patterns
- **Database Operations**: Efficient query execution
- **Batch Processing**: Optimize batch append operations

### Web App Optimization
- **HTTP Layer**: Optimize request/response handling
- **JSON Processing**: Efficient serialization/deserialization

## Use Case Recommendations

### When to Use Go Library
- **High-frequency operations** requiring maximum performance
- **Direct database access** applications
- **Algorithm development** and optimization
- **Memory-constrained** environments
- **Core performance** validation

### When to Use Web App
- **HTTP-based integrations** and microservices
- **Distributed systems** requiring HTTP APIs
- **Production deployments** with multiple clients
- **Load-balanced** environments
- **Real-world API performance** validation

## Summary

**Go Library Performance** measures core algorithm efficiency and is excellent for high-performance applications requiring direct database access.

**Web App Performance** measures production HTTP API performance and validates the system's ability to handle real-world load scenarios.

**Both performance measurements are valuable** for their respective purposes, but they should not be compared directly as they measure fundamentally different aspects of the system.

The **700x performance difference** between Go library and web app is **expected and normal** for a production HTTP service compared to direct library calls.
