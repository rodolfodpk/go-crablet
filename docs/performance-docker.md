## Operation Types Explained

### **Simple Read vs Complex Queries**

The performance tables show two different types of read operations:

#### **Simple Read**
- **What it tests**: Single query operations with basic tag filtering
- **Example**: `Query events with tag "user_id" = "123"`
- **Use case**: Basic event retrieval, simple filtering
- **Performance**: Fastest read operations

#### **Complex Queries** 
- **What it tests**: Multi-step business workflows with sequential queries
- **Example**: Complete course enrollment process:
  1. Query if student exists (`StudentRegistered` event)
  2. Query if course exists (`CourseDefined` event)
  3. Query if student is already enrolled (`StudentEnrolledInCourse` event)
  4. Append enrollment event
- **Use case**: Business rule validation, multi-step workflows, real-world scenarios
- **Performance**: Slower than simple reads due to multiple sequential operations

#### **Why Performance Differs Between Datasets**

| Dataset | Simple Read | Complex Queries | Performance Pattern |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Tiny** | 3,649 ops/sec | 2,058 ops/sec | Complex queries are 1.8x slower than Simple Read |
| **Small** | 337 ops/sec | 361 ops/sec | Complex queries are 1.1x slower than Simple Read |

**Tiny Dataset**: Complex queries are slower because they perform 4 sequential operations, and the overhead of multiple queries is more significant with minimal data.

**Small Dataset**: Complex queries are slower (1.1x) because they still perform 4 sequential operations, but the performance difference is smaller due to:
- **Better query optimization** with more data
- **Improved indexing efficiency** 
- **Reduced per-operation overhead** at scale
- **Real-world data patterns** that optimize better

### **Append vs AppendIf**

#### **Append**
- **What it tests**: Simple event storage without business rule validation
- **Use case**: High-volume event streaming, event-driven architectures
- **Performance**: Fastest operation (850+ ops/sec)

#### **AppendIf**
- **What it tests**: Conditional event storage with business rule validation
- **Use case**: Event sourcing with business consistency, preventing duplicate operations
- **Performance**: Significantly slower (10+ ops/sec) due to:
  - Business rule validation queries
  - Conflict detection logic
  - Past event scanning for conditions

**Performance Impact**: AppendIf is 85x slower than Append, but provides business consistency guarantees that simple Append cannot.
