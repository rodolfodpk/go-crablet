# Docker PostgreSQL Performance

## Performance Results

### Throughput Calculation

**Throughput (ops/sec)** represents the number of API operations completed per second, calculated as:
- **Formula**: `total_operations / elapsed_time_seconds`
- **Where**: `total_operations = benchmark_iterations Ã— concurrency_level`
- **Example**: If a benchmark runs 1000 iterations with 10 concurrent users, total operations = 10,000
- **Measurement**: Uses Go's `testing.B.Elapsed()` for precise timing and `b.ReportMetric()` for reporting
- **Note**: This measures API calls per second, not individual events or database transactions

## Append Performance

**Append Operations Details**:
- **Operation**: Simple event append operations
- **Scenario**: Basic event writing without conditions or business logic
- **Events**: Single event (1) or batch (100 events)
- **Model**: Generic test events with simple JSON data

**Column Explanations**:
- **Dataset**: Test data size (Tiny: 5 courses/10 students, Small: 1K courses/10K students, Medium: 1K courses/10K students)
- **Concurrency**: Number of concurrent users/goroutines running operations simultaneously
- **Events**: Number of events appended per operation (1 = single event, 10 = batch of 10 events)
- **Throughput (ops/sec)**: Operations completed per second (higher is better)
- **Latency (ms/op)**: Time per operation in milliseconds (lower is better)
- **Memory (KB/op)**: Memory allocated per operation in kilobytes (lower is better)
- **Allocations**: Number of memory allocations per operation (lower is better)
