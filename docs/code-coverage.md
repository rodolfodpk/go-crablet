3. **Event Store Operations** (78-92% coverage)
   - `Read()` method edge cases
   - `NewEventStore()` error conditions

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Test Categories**

#### **Unit Tests**
- Individual function behavior
- Input validation
- Error conditions
- Edge cases

#### **Integration Tests**
- Event store operations
- Database interactions
- Transaction handling
- Concurrency scenarios

#### **Performance Tests**
- Large dataset handling
- Memory usage
- Throughput measurements
- Stress testing

### **Test Coverage Tools**

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./pkg/dcb

# View detailed function coverage
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# Generate HTML coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./pkg/dcb

# Run tests with memory profiling
go test -memprofile=mem.prof ./pkg/dcb
```

### **Coverage Analysis Commands**

```bash
# Check coverage for specific functions
go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep -E "(Read|Append|Project)"

# Generate coverage report for specific package
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./pkg/dcb ./pkg/dcb

# View coverage in browser
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

## üîç **Coverage Exclusions**

### **What's Excluded and Why**

| Directory | Reason | Coverage Impact |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **`internal/benchmarks/`** | Performance benchmarks, not unit tests | Excluded |
| **`internal/examples/`** | Example applications, not library code | Excluded |
| **`docs/`** | Documentation files | Excluded |
| **`cmd/`** | Command-line tools | Excluded |

### **Justification for Exclusions**

- **Benchmarks**: Performance testing, not functional testing
- **Examples**: Demonstrations and tutorials, not core library
- **Documentation**: Markdown files, not code
- **CLI Tools**: Separate applications, not library code

## üìà **Improvement Guidelines**

### **Adding New Tests**

1. **Follow existing patterns** in test files
2. **Test both success and failure cases**
3. **Include edge cases and boundary conditions**
4. **Test concurrent operations where applicable**
5. **Add benchmarks for performance-critical code**

### **Test Quality Standards**

- **Descriptive test names** that explain what's being tested
- **Minimal test setup** with clear arrange/act/assert structure
- **Comprehensive assertions** that verify all expected outcomes
- **Proper cleanup** of test resources
- **Documentation** for complex test scenarios

### **Coverage Improvement Process**

1. **Identify low-coverage areas** using coverage reports
2. **Prioritize critical functions** and public APIs
3. **Add unit tests** for uncovered code paths
4. **Add integration tests** for complex scenarios
5. **Verify coverage improvement** with updated reports

## üö® **Critical Paths Requiring 100% Coverage**

## üìä **Coverage Monitoring**

### **Continuous Integration**

```yaml
# Example CI configuration for coverage monitoring
- name: Run Tests with Coverage
  run: |
    go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./pkg/dcb
    go tool cover -func=coverage.out

- name: Check Coverage Threshold
  run: |
    COVERAGE=$(go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/%//')
    if (( $(echo "$COVERAGE < 85" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "Coverage below threshold: $COVERAGE%"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### **Coverage Reports**

- **Function-level coverage**: Detailed breakdown by function
- **Line-level coverage**: Specific lines that need testing
- **Branch coverage**: Conditional logic coverage
- **HTML reports**: Visual coverage analysis

## üîß **Tools and Resources**

### **Go Testing Tools**
- `go test`: Standard Go testing framework
- `go tool cover`: Coverage analysis tool
- `testify`: Testing utilities and assertions
- `gomock`: Mock generation for testing

### **Coverage Analysis Tools**
- **Codecov**: Continuous coverage monitoring
- **Coveralls**: Coverage tracking and reporting
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and coverage analysis

### **Best Practices**
- **Test-driven development**: Write tests before implementation
- **Continuous testing**: Run tests on every change
- **Coverage thresholds**: Enforce minimum coverage levels
- **Regular reviews**: Periodically review and improve test coverage

## üìù **Conclusion**

The DCB library maintains good test coverage at **86.7%** for the core library, with comprehensive testing of critical operations. The focus should be on:

1. **Improving streaming operation coverage** (currently 70%)
2. **Adding edge case tests** for helper functions
3. **Enhancing error condition testing**
4. **Maintaining high coverage** for new features

Regular monitoring and improvement of test coverage ensures the reliability and maintainability of the DCB library.
